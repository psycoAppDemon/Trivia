Android Quiz Application

MOTIVE : To learn using the newest techniques of android technology.

ABOUT APP : An application that presents questions on specific topics to the user based on users choice.      
For each topic listed on the UI there are certain sets of questions. Problem-sets are randomly allotted to the
User. After each quiz, responses are saved in his local storage. Users can also reset their progress.

CURRENT PROGRESS : Till now I’m able to fetch data from the internet in the form of JSON objects and using Volley Library, parsed them. 
Currently users can answer problems, can start from where he/she left, check scores and reset their current quizzes progress. Looking for 
adding functionality to keep history of user’s progress.
